# HelloOpenHands Roadmap

## Current Status

The project currently supports:
- ✅ Bash script (`hello.sh`)
- ✅ Python script (`hello.py`) 
- ✅ TypeScript script (`hello.ts`)
- ✅ C program (`hello.c`) with Makefile build system
- ✅ C# program (`hello.cs`) with .NET project system (tested on macOS)
- ✅ Rust program (`hello.rs`) with Cargo build system (tested on macOS)
- ✅ Go program (`hello.go`) with go build/run support (tested on macOS)
- ✅ Java program (`Hello.java`) with javac/java compilation (tested on macOS)
- ✅ JavaScript program (`hello.js`) with Node.js runtime (tested on macOS)
- ✅ F# script (`hello.fsx`) with .NET F# Interactive support (tested on macOS)
- ✅ VB.NET program (`hello.vb`) with .NET project system (tested on macOS)
- ✅ ARM64 Assembly program (`hello.s`) with macOS system calls (tested on macOS M1)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite for all implementations
- ✅ Documentation and usage instructions

## Planned Features

### Language Implementations

- ✅ **Rust** - Add `hello.rs` with Cargo build system
- ✅ **Go** - Add `hello.go` with go build/run support
- ✅ **Java** - Add `Hello.java` with compilation instructions
- ✅ **JavaScript (Node.js)** - Add pure Node.js version (separate from TypeScript)
- ✅ **F#** - Add `hello.fsx` with .NET F# Interactive support
- ✅ **VB.NET** - Add `hello.vb` with .NET VB.NET support
- ✅ **ARM64 Assembly** - Add `hello.s` with macOS system calls for M1

### Build & Testing Improvements

- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline** - Add GitHub Actions for automated testing
- [ ] **Docker Support** - Add Dockerfile for containerized execution
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking** - Compare execution times across languages
- [ ] **Code Coverage** - Add coverage reporting for test suite

### Documentation Enhancements

- [ ] **Language Comparison** - Add section comparing syntax and features
- [ ] **Installation Guides** - Detailed setup instructions for each language
- [ ] **Contributing Guidelines** - Add CONTRIBUTING.md for new contributors
- [ ] **Code Examples** - Expand beyond hello world to demonstrate language features

### Project Structure

- [ ] **Language Subdirectories** - Organize code by language (optional)
- [ ] **Shared Utilities** - Common test utilities and helpers
- [ ] **Configuration Files** - Centralized configuration for builds and tests

## Future Considerations

- **WebAssembly** - Compile C/Rust to WASM for browser execution
- **Mobile Platforms** - Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android) implementations
- **Functional Languages** - Haskell, Clojure implementations
- **Assembly Language** - Low-level implementation for educational purposes

## Contributing

Each new language implementation should follow the established patterns:

1. Source file with consistent output format
2. Build/execution instructions
3. Test script following naming convention
4. Documentation updates
5. Integration with master test runner
